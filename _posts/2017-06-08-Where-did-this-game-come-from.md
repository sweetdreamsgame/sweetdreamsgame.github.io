Welcome to the new devlog of Sweet Dreams. If you are here now, I think it's important to give you some context to what we are, what you'll find here, and how we got here in the first place. 

Sweet dreams is a game that started in a Game Jam. You know, that thing you have 48 hours to make a game? Yeah, that's right!
But this game jam was quite different from the game jams we have previously participated.
Besides the game, we had to make a business out of it. Oh, what do I mean with it?
I mean we had to make the game and some business, marketing, and other strategies to launch the game.
I told you that we only had 48 hours, right? It was insane, but somehow it was very fun. 

We made it. The game was out ready (ready or not, here I go) to present to the judges.
Whoa, judges? Yeah, we had to present the game after 48 hours non-sleep.
After some discussion, they came out with the results. And suddenly, we were the first from the state to classify to the Finals.
And from that day on we are working to go stronger to the finals. And that is how we got here. 

Sweet Dreams is a multiplayer game to hit others with your pillow. We want to bring back the emotion from the old local multiplayer games.
.........

We intend to bring to this devlog a lot of useful and fun content. I mean, it's about a game. It must be fun. 
We'll have new features of the game announced here, as well as old stuff we decide to get out of it for whatever reason.
Besides that, we want to have development tips. Things we think it would make it easier your development life (or somenone else's). Thing we wish we had known before. 

For the presentation, I think we are good for now. Maybe a screenshot or two to end this?
